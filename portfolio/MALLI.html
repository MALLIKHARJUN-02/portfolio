		<h3>1) Home Automation Using NI LabVIEW</h3>
		<p>LabVIEW can be used to help with your industrial automation. Home automation refers to the
		automatic and electronic control of household features, activity, and appliances.</p>

		<h3>2) Design and Analysis of a Dual-Band Patch Antenna for Wireless Applications.</h3>
		<p>Microstrip antenna is the main key building for wireless communication. The proposed antenna 	suitable for 	wireless 		applications such as X-band (8-12GHz).</p>

		<h3>3) Gas Leakage Detector</h3>
		<p>Many accidents occur in day-to-day life like explosion because of LPG leakage. A Prototype 	model is 	implemented to 			continuously monitor the level of LPG gas present in the air.</p>

		<h3>4) Implementation and Analysis of 6-Transistor SRAM Cell</h3>
		<p>The analysis of the 6-transistor SRAM using Cadence software in the 45-nanometer technology
		Generation reveals important insights into power consumption, delay characterization, and layout 	design.</p>

		<h3>5) Student Database Management System Development using C++</h3>
		<p>This student database management system efficiently handles student records by allowing 
		creation, access, update, and deletion of student information. It ensures data validation and uses 	file handling for 			persistent storage. Overall, it provides a reliable way to manage student 	academic records.</p>

		<h3>6) Basic Banking System with Transaction History using C</h3>
		<p>This project implements a simple banking system with account creation, login, and 
		transaction capabilities. It uses a linked list for account management and dynamic memory for 	transaction histories, providing 		a command-line interface for user interactions.</p>
